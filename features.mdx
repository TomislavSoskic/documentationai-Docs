## Project Organization and Folders

Organize docs hierarchically with unlimited nested folders. Assign permissions per folder for team access control.

| Feature | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Nested Folders | Create subfolders like `docs/api/v1/` | Large projects with versioned APIs |
| Bulk Move | Drag multiple files at once | Restructuring after milestones |
| Searchable Tags | Add tags like `draft`, `published` | Quick filtering beyond folders |

## Version Control Basics

Every edit creates a snapshot. View history, compare diffs, and restore previous versions without external Git.

    A[Create Doc] --> B[Edit 1]
    B --> C[Edit 2]
    C --> D[Publish]
    D --> E[View History]
    E --> F[Restore Version]
```

<CodeGroup tabs="CLI,API">
  ```bash
  # Fetch version history
  tsoskic docs history --project my-project --doc api-guide
  ```
  ```javascript
  // API call to list versions
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/docs/my-project/api-guide/versions');
  const versions = await response.json();
  console.log(versions);
  ```
